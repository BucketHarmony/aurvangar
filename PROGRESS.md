## SCAFFOLD — initial repository (2026-09-25)
- Done: docs, specs, backlog, data files, solution, Aurvangar.Sim foundation (Core, ContentDb, VoxelWorld, Simulation
  loop, commands, events, state hash), scaffolds with typed stubs for water, pathing, agents, actions, buildings,
  save. ViewCore mesher stubs. Headless runner. Godot project shell with fixed-tick GameRoot. Scripts, hooks,
  agents, CI.
- Tests: 35 foundation tests pass. 124 acceptance tests are skipped with their backlog task id.
- Verified in the scaffolding environment: Aurvangar.Sim, Aurvangar.ViewCore and Aurvangar.Headless build with .NET 8.0.131;
  the test sources compile and the non-skipped tests pass under a local xUnit stand-in. NOT verified there (NuGet
  was unreachable): the real xUnit run and the Godot.NET.Sdk build. M0-T1 verifies both.
- Next: M0-T1.
